# Quick_Encrypter

The code works by changing every byte in a given file according to a table that is generated based on a seed that works as a key to encrypt and decrypt files.

NOTE: Not Secure, I don't recommend using it with important files. It was made just for fun and educational purposes.

Usage: [executable] [filename] [mode] [key]
